      Welcome! This page presents the research areas and problems I want to pursue and tackle in the upcoming academic year. 
  </p>

  <p><b>Why you should work with us (me and my students)?</b> Because this is how you can work on cutting-edge research that makes a difference and feel rewarded in several material and immaterial ways. Particularly, because:
  <ul>
  <li>our work pushes the barriers of mobile accessibility and usable privacy and has been featured regularly in the best international conferences, winning best paper awards (see <a href="http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~tjvg/publications_year.html"> my publications</a>);</li>
  <li>our work is done in collaboration with international researchers that often come to visit and welcome your visit for short stays. Anabela, a current Master student, will start mid-January an Erasmus+ 4-month stay at the University of Newcastle, in a collaboration I maintain with the OpenLab, one of the best HCI research labs in the world. In the past, other visits to Europe and the US were funded. These collaborations, even done remotely, expose you to new enviroments and processes that can greatly enlarge your knowledge and vision. My students often publish at international conferences and have their travel and stay payed by our group. Our work is often presented to companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft;</li>
  <li>we work closely with target users guaranteeing access to representative samples. Particularly for projects in the accessibility area this access is pivotal to the quality of the work. Students working with me will learn more from users in the real world than they will in the laboratory. Only by doing so we will be able to make a real difference. This contact with real users is also key for us to leave a visible footprint: our solutions get to the end users, even if only those that collaborated with our research, but most of the times are made available to the broader population (see <a href="http://braille21.com">Braille21.com</a>. Cheers to making a difference in the world!</li>
  <li>we provide you with a healthy and exciting working environment. Our work is done in collaboration, we meet regularly (at least once a week) but will probably discuss your research briefly almost everyday. We will design solutions together, with me, my phd students, and other collaborators, and will all learn a lot. Most likely we will code and write together;
  </li>
  <li> and more reasons you will find out if you accept the challenge!</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

    <p><b>Why now?</b> I am sharing the proposals now, when we are having no classes, because this is the time of the year when I am most available to prepare my research, launch new projects and collaborations. As such, I am using <b>January</b> as the month to plan my future research and, if you want to work with me in the next year, this is <b>when you should meet me and discuss your ideas and plans</b>. Although you may not want to commit right away with a proposal (you don't need to), I want to have a clear idea of the proposals that might go forward.</p>
  </p>

  <p><b>Are you the student I am looking for?</b> I am looking for students that like to be challenged and like to learn. My main concern when taking a student to work with me is to understand if she/he is motivated. Motivation and initiative are key. </p>

<p>
  If you want to work with me, come and meet me and let's discuss what you would like to do. I want to give you my full attention so I am only taking students in areas I am doing research. This way I am sure I can teach you the most and be engaged with your weekly advances. The list above shows the topics I am considering to propose as master thesis projects for next year. If you are interested in any or many of them, do contact me ASAP.</p>
